# Eliza-chatbot-using-python

Eliza chatbot was first developed by Joseph Weizenbaum in 1966, it is one of the earliest chatbot developed by using Natural Language processing concepts. It is a rule-based chatbot, it uses pattern matching to identify keywords from user input and transforms user's input to reply by performing transformations using predefined patterns or rules.

In this program I used python to create a chatbot that works similar to  Eliza, I also used the rules and methodology that were discussed in the original paper by Joseph Weizenbaum, so that the program mimics original Eliza chat bot.
